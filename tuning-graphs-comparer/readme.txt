Simple app for comparing two graphs.
I find it very useful when comparing timing and fuel mappings, so I decided to upload this utility app on github.

It's very simple to use:
1. start the app (If you need help with compiling, contact me. I may also upload executable in the future)
2. enter the graph's width and height (number of columns and rows)
3. paste the first graph (Just as you copied it from EcuFlash)
4. paste the second graph
5. check the generated file where you will find 3 graphs. The first one, the second one and a third one, containing the difference between the two.
